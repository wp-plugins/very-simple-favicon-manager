== DESCRIPTION ==
This is a very simple plugin to add an IOS site icon or a favicon in the address bar of your browser.

When no favicon or site icon is added, a default favicon or site icon will be used.

Because nowadays there are multiple default site icon sizes not all devices are covered. 

Question? Please take a look at the FAQ section.

== INSTALLATION ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What are the best image extensions and sizes for a favicon and site icon? =
For desktop and laptop browsers I recommend using a square multi-size .ico file (called favicon) and with sizes 16x16px, 32x32px and 48x48px. The minimum is a single 16x16px favicon.

Nowadays there are multiple default site icon sizes, depending on device. 

For IOS device I recommend using a square icon with extension .png and size 180x180px.

Android device often uses the IOS site icon.

For Windows (mobile) device it's not clear to me.

= What's a multi-size .ico file? =
An .ico file can contain multiple favicons, so it can contain a 16x16px, 32x32px and 48x48px favicon.

= Can I use a .png in stead of .ico favicon? =
Normally it's possible (although .png is less supported) but this plugin only supports the .ico favicon.

= What happens when I leave 1 or both input fields blank? =
When no favicon or site icon link is added, a default favicon or site icon will be used.

= Can I use your plugin in combination with the new site icon feature in WordPress dashboard? =
No, you should not use both.

= Other question or comment? =
Please open a topic in plugin forum or send me a message via my website.
