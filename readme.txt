== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What's the best image extension and size for a favicon? =
Nowadays there are several default favicon sizes, depending on browser and device. I recommend using a square icon with extension .ico and size 16x16px or 32x32px.

= Can I use .png or .jpg file in stead of .ico file? =
Yes, but the favicon will not be visible in all browsers.

= Other question or comment? =
Please open a topic in plugin forum or send me a message via my website.
