== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What are the best image extensions and sizes for a favicon and app icon? =
Nowadays there are several default favicon and app icon sizes, depending on browser and device. 

For desktop and laptop browsers I recommend using a square icon with extension .ico or .png and size 16x16px or 32x32px.

For IOS device I recommend using a square icon with extension .png and size 180x180px.

For Android device I recommend using a square icon with extension .png and size 192x192px.

= Can I use your plugin in combination with the new site icon feature in WordPress dashboard? =
No, you should not use both.
